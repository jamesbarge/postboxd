# Milestone v1.0: Scraper Fix

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-10
**Phases:** 1-2
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Fix 4 broken cinema scrapers and run all high-priority scrapers to populate screening data through end of February 2026.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Diagnose & Fix Scrapers

**Goal**: Find and fix why 4 scrapers produce no data
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Diagnose broken scrapers and fix issues

**Findings:**
- Root cause: Database schema missing `manually_edited` and `edited_at` columns
- Genesis: Date extraction needed to parse panel IDs instead of text
- Lexi: JSON regex needed bracket-matching instead of non-greedy pattern
- Phoenix & Castle Sidcup: Were working, just blocked by DB schema

### Phase 2: Run High-Priority Scrapers

**Goal**: Execute main chain scrapers to populate February data
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Run all high-priority scrapers

**Results:**
| Scraper | Screenings | Venues |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Genesis | 104 | 1 |
| Lexi | 103 | 1 |
| Phoenix | 25 | 1 |
| Castle Sidcup | 66 | 1 |
| Curzon | 990 | 10 |
| Everyman | 1048 | 14 |
| Picturehouse | 1668 | 11 |
| BFI | 424 | 2 |
| Barbican | 41 | 1 |
| Electric | 60 | 1 |

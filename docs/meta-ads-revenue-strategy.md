# London Cinema Calendar: Paid Advertising & Revenue Strategy

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive go-to-market strategy to monetize a London cinema calendar app targeting repertory film enthusiasts. The strategy prioritizes **validation before scale**, using Meta Ads to acquire subscribers at a target CAC of **£3-4** for a **£2.99/month** subscription, achieving payback within 6-8 weeks.

---

## Part 1: Subscription Pricing Strategy

### Recommended Pricing Model

| Tier | Price | Billing | Effective Monthly | Target Segment |
|------|-------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Monthly** | £2.99/month | Recurring | £2.99 | Casual film-goers, trial converts |
| **Annual** | £24.99/year | One-time | £2.08 | Committed cinephiles |
| **Founding Member** (Launch only) | £19.99/year | One-time | £1.67 | Early adopters, community builders |

### Pricing Rationale

**Why £2.99/month (not £1.99 or £4.99):**

1. **Psychological threshold**: £2.99 sits below the £3 mental barrier while signaling sufficient value
2. **Unit economics viability**: Allows for £3-4 CAC with 6-8 week payback
3. **Competitive positioning**: Undercuts streaming services (£5.99-£15.99) while positioning above "free with ads" alternatives
4. **Niche premium**: Film enthusiasts expect to pay for curated, specialized tools

**Annual discount strategy**: The 30% discount (£24.99 vs £35.88) is aggressive enough to drive annual conversions while the Founding Member tier creates urgency and rewards early adoption.

### Revenue Projections

| Month | Monthly Subs | Annual Subs | MRR | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----|-------|
| 1 | 50 | 20 | £190 | Validation phase |
| 3 | 200 | 80 | £763 | Optimization phase |
| 6 | 500 | 250 | £2,014 | Scaling begins |
| 12 | 1,200 | 600 | £4,638 | Sustainable growth |

### Ad Concepts

**Format**: Video (15-30 seconds), Reel, Story

**Script:**
```
[Screen recording style, fast-paced]

"Okay, what's on at cinema this weekend..."
[Opens BFI website]
"Ooh, they have that Wenders retrospective..."
[Opens new tab - Curzon]
"But Curzon might have the new Kore-eda..."
[Opens new tab - Barbican]
"Wait, Barbican has a late-night Cronenberg..."
[Opens tabs: Picturehouse, ICA, Prince Charles, Genesis]
"Maybe I'll just stay home."

[Cut to app interface]
"Or... see everything in one place."

FilmCal. Every London indie cinema. One calendar.
£2.99/month. Try free for 7 days.
```

**Visual Direction:**

#### Concept 2: "The One That Got Away" (FOMO/Urgency)

A beautiful still from a classic film (or stylized illustration to avoid copyright), with overlay text:

```
"The 70mm Interstellar screening
at BFI IMAX sold out.

You found out 3 days later
on Letterboxd."
```

**Carousel Slides:**
1. FOMO hook (above)
2. "FilmCal alerts you when rare screenings drop"
3. "Filter by format: 35mm, 70mm, IMAX"
4. App screenshot showing alert feature
5. CTA: "Never miss a screening. Try free."

**Visual Direction:**
- Moody, cinematic color grading
- Film grain overlay for authenticity
- Clean typography, generous white space
- Subtle urgency without being aggressive

#### Concept 3: "The Cinema Lover's Cheat Code" (Value Proposition)

Join 3,000+ film lovers. £2.99/month.
```

**Visual Direction:**

- Film-inspired color palette (deep blacks, warm highlights)

#### Concept 4: "Behind the Velvet Rope" (Exclusivity/Community)

**Format**: Video testimonial or UGC-style

**Script:**
```
[Person walking into cinema, POV shot]

"I used to spend Sunday mornings planning my week's cinema trips.
Now I spend Sunday mornings actually watching films."

[Shows phone with app]

"FilmCal is like having a friend who works at every indie cinema in London.
The 35mm alerts alone are worth it."

[Cut to them in cinema seat, credits rolling]

"Last month I caught a surprise Kubrick double bill at Prince Charles
that I never would have found."

FilmCal. For people who take cinema seriously.
```

**Visual Direction:**
- Authentic, not polished

"The London Independent Cinema Calendar"

**Body:**
```
One app. Every screening. All your favorite cinemas.

BFI Southbank · Curzon · Barbican · ICA

```

**Visual Direction:**

|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Video (15-30s) | 40% | Awareness, Reels, Stories |
| Static Image | 35% | Feed, Conversion |
| Carousel | 15% | Feature education |
| UGC/Testimonial | 10% | Social proof, Retargeting |

### Creative Testing Framework

**Phase 1: Hook Testing (Week 1-2)**

Test 3 different opening hooks with the same body:
1. Problem-focused: "Tired of checking 12 websites?"
2. Benefit-focused: "Every London indie cinema, one calendar"
3. Identity-focused: "For Londoners who take cinema seriously"

**Phase 2: Format Testing (Week 3-4)**

Winner from Phase 1, test across:
1. Static image
2. Video (15s)
3. Carousel
4. Story-native format

**Phase 3: Audience-Creative Matching (Week 5-6)**

Pair winning creatives with audience segments:
- Cinephiles get insider/community messaging

## Part 6: Unit Economics Analysis

### Core Metrics

| Metric | Target | Calculation |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Monthly subscription price | £2.99 | - |
| Annual subscription price | £24.99 | £2.08/month effective |
| Target CAC | £3.50 | Blended across channels |
| Payment processor fees | 3% + £0.20 | Stripe UK |
| Net revenue per monthly sub | £2.70 | £2.99 - (£0.09 + £0.20) |
| Net revenue per annual sub | £24.04 | £24.99 - (£0.75 + £0.20) |

### Subscriber Lifetime Value

**Assumptions:**
- Monthly churn: 8% (12.5 month average lifetime)
- Annual renewal: 70%
- Annual:Monthly subscriber ratio: 30:70

**Monthly Subscriber LTV:**
```
Average lifetime = 1/0.08 = 12.5 months
LTV = 12.5 × £2.70 = £33.75
```

**Annual Subscriber LTV:**
```
Year 1 = £24.04
Year 2 (70% renew) = 0.7 × £24.04 = £16.83
Year 3 (70% of Y2) = 0.7 × £16.83 = £11.78
Total LTV = £52.65
```

**Blended LTV (70% monthly, 30% annual):**
```
Blended LTV = (0.7 × £33.75) + (0.3 × £52.65) = £39.42
```

### LTV:CAC Ratio

| Scenario | CAC | LTV:CAC | Verdict |
|----------|-----|---------|---------|
| Target | £3.50 | 11.3:1 | Excellent |
| Acceptable | £5.00 | 7.9:1 | Good |
| Break-even (monthly) | £33.75 | 1:1 | Minimum viable |

**Industry benchmark**: SaaS/subscription typically targets 3:1 LTV:CAC. At 11:1, this business has significant headroom for scaling or margin.

### Payback Period

| Subscriber Type | CAC | Monthly Net Rev | Payback Period |
|-----------------|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| Monthly | £3.50 | £2.70 | 5.4 weeks |
| Annual | £3.50 | £24.04 (upfront) | Immediate |
| Blended | £3.50 | - | ~6 weeks |

### Monthly P&L Projection (at 1,000 subscribers)

| Line Item | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Revenue** | | |
| Monthly subs (700 × £2.99) | £2,093 | |
| Annual subs (300 × £2.08) | £624 | Monthly equivalent |
| **Gross Revenue** | **£2,717** | |
| | | |
| **Costs** | | |
| Payment processing | (£120) | ~4.4% blended |
| Hosting/Infrastructure | (£50) | Vercel, Supabase, etc. |
| Paid acquisition | (£700) | ~200 new subs × £3.50 |
| **Total Costs** | **(£870)** | |
| | | |
| **Net Contribution** | **£1,847** | 68% margin |

### Sensitivity Analysis

| Variable | Change | Impact on CAC Target |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Price increase to £3.99 | +33% revenue | CAC can increase to £4.50 |
| Churn increases to 12% | -25% LTV | CAC must decrease to £2.75 |
| Annual ratio to 50% | +15% blended LTV | CAC can increase to £4.00 |
| Trial conversion drops to 30% | +33% effective CAC | Optimize funnel urgently |

### Weekly Optimization Checklist

**Every Monday:**
- [ ] Pull previous week's CAC by ad set
- [ ] Identify bottom 20% performers (by CAC)
- [ ] Check frequency on retargeting (should be < 4/week)
- [ ] Review creative fatigue (CTR decline > 20% = refresh)
- [ ] Check trial-to-paid conversion trend

**Optimization Decision Tree:**

```
CAC above target?
├── Yes → Is CTR below 1%?
│   ├── Yes → Creative problem. Test new hooks.
│   └── No → Is CPC above £1?
│       ├── Yes → Audience too competitive. Test new segments.
│       └── No → Is LPV rate below 80%?
│           ├── Yes → Technical issue. Check mobile experience.
│           └── No → Is trial start rate below 3%?
│               ├── Yes → Landing page problem. A/B test.
│               └── No → Trial-to-paid issue. Check onboarding.
│
└── No → Is there room to scale?
    ├── Yes → Increase budget 20%, monitor for 3 days.
    └── No → Test expansion audiences (Lookalikes, new geos).
```

## Part 10: Beyond Paid Ads - Complementary Channels

While Meta Ads should be the primary acquisition engine, these complementary channels can reduce CAC and build sustainable growth:

### Organic & Community (Low Cost, High Trust)

| Channel | Effort | Expected Impact | Timeline |
|---------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Letterboxd engagement | 2 hrs/week | 10-20 subs/month | Ongoing |
| Reddit r/london, r/movies | 2 hrs/week | 5-15 subs/month | Ongoing |
| Film Twitter/X | 3 hrs/week | 10-20 subs/month | Ongoing |
| Local film club partnerships | 4 hrs/month | 20-50 subs/event | Quarterly |

### Referral Program

**Structure:**
- Give £1 credit, get £1 credit (for monthly subs)
- Give 1 month free, get 1 month free (for annuals)
- Cap at 3 referrals per user

**Expected CAC equivalent:** £1-2 per referred subscriber

### Cinema Partnerships

**Approach:**
- Offer co-branded content to cinema marketing teams
- "Powered by FilmCal" badge on their screening pages
- Revenue share or flat monthly fee for API access

**Potential partners:**
- Prince Charles Cinema (community-focused, likely receptive)
- Genesis Cinema (independent, locally focused)
- ICA (arts institution, interested in innovation)

## Summary: Critical Success Factors

1. **Price at £2.99/month** - Sweet spot between value perception and unit economics viability

2. **Target CAC of £3.50** - Achievable with tight targeting; provides 11:1 LTV:CAC ratio

3. **Lead with problem, not product** - "End the endless scroll" resonates more than feature lists

4. **Start narrow, expand carefully** - Begin with high-intent audiences (Letterboxd, Criterion, BFI interests) before broadening

5. **Refresh creative every 2 weeks** - London audiences are sophisticated; fatigue hits fast

6. **Optimize for trial-to-paid** - This is where most subscription businesses fail; invest in onboarding

7. **Build community alongside acquisition** - Referrals and organic will reduce CAC over time

8. **Track obsessively, decide quickly** - Weekly optimization is essential; don't let underperformers drain budget

/**
 * useSafeDateLabels Hook
 *
 * Provides SSR-safe date comparison functions that prevent hydration mismatches.
 *
 * Problem: date-fns functions like isToday() and isTomorrow() internally call
 * new Date() to get "now". During SSR, "now" is server time. During hydration,
 * "now" is client time. If these differ (e.g., near midnight, different timezones),
 * the rendered output differs, causing React hydration errors.
 *
 * Solution: These wrapper functions only return true AFTER hydration completes.
 * During SSR and initial hydration, they return false, so components render
 * the full date format. After hydration, they return the actual result,
 * allowing React's normal update cycle to show "Today/Tomorrow" labels.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const { isClientToday, isClientTomorrow, isClientThisWeek } = useSafeDateLabels();
 *
 *   // This is safe - returns false during SSR, actual value after hydration
 *   if (isClientToday(date)) return "Today";
 *   return format(date, "EEEE d MMMM");
